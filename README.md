ViolentMod
==========

My mod, many features are planned for it and I hope to implement some of them soon :)

How to Build
==========
If you want to pick up the most recent features that are not released in a build yet, then this is how to do it!

1)Clone this repository onto your computer. You can do this using Git, Github for windows or any other git-type program. 
  Personally, I use Git.

2)Shift-Right Click in the folder where you cloned the repository. You should see an option which says "Open a Command        Window Here", click on it.

3)In command prompt, enter either "gradlew setupCIWorkspace" or "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace".

4)That takes a while, but once it's done enter the command "gradlew build".

5)Once that's done, open the build folder in your repository directory then open the libs folder.

6)Now you have your build with the most up to date features =)

Contributing
============
If you would like to help me make my mod, contribute!

1)First fork my repository so you have your own copy of it.

2)Make the changes you want to make to my code inside of your fork.

3)Make a pull request inside my repository which includes the changes you made in your fork, include a little description of what you've done!

4)If I like what you've changed, or if it fixes a major error, then I will merge the pull request =)
